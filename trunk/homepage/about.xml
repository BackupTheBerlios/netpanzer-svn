  <section title="What is netPanzer?">
    <p>
      netPanzer is an online multiplayer tactical warfare game designed for
      FAST ACTION combat. Gameplay concentrates on the core -- no resource
      management is needed. The game is based on quick tactical action and unit
      management in real-time. Battles progress quickly and constantly as
      destroyed players respawn with a set of new units. Players can join or
      leave multiplayer games at any time.

      Official netPanzer development got basically halted in 1999,
      since 2002 netPanzer is available under the <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> and thus
      Free Software and a GNU/Linux port of netPanzer is ready.
