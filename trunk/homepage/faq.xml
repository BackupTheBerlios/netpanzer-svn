        </question>

        <answer>
          This game was designed to make players fight--no sitting
          around waiting for your opponents to waste themselves in
          combat and then wiping them out. Players will be battling for
          outposts, so that they can increase their unit count.

        <question>How do I build more units, if there are no resources?</question>
        <answer>
          By capturing an outpost, a player can build more units. Each
          unit has a specific build time. A major strategy in the game
          will be capturing and holding onto outposts. Each outpost a
          player owns can produce units for the player.
