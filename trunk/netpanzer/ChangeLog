 files there)

-added the NoCopy class for cases where you want to forbid

14-Sep-2003 by Ivo Danihelka
-converted sdlsound to use physfs, Mix_LoadMUS_RW is not used yet

14-Sep-2003 by Matthias Braun
-applied sound patch by Ivo Danihelka (thanks alot)
-added code to construct SDL_RWops in physfs files

12-Sep-2003 by Matthias Braun
-use the physfs for the colortable cache now
-removed lots of unused code from Surface class
-removed the screenshot function (this allowed to remove the BMP saver too).
 because there are external screenshot tools around.

11-Sep-2003 by Matthias Braun
-removed more win32 specific code
-removed #ifdef USE_SDLs, the code is enabled by default now
-added a new commandline parser
-smaller fixes/cleanups

10-Sep-2003 by Matthias Braun
-more random cleanups
-more cleanups so that the Stub directory is empty now
-fixed the bug where the TileEngine didn't correctly draw the last line
-removed the strange PObject class (still some utility classes which formerly
 dealt with PObject are there and are - as before - quiet useless). The long
  story:
  It seemed like PObject was planed as some generic base type which provided a
  uniform interface to functions like comparing 2 objects. But since the only
  function is_equal in PObject wasn't virtual, and since it was never used I
  decided that this stuff is quiet useless.
-removed most of the win32 specific code

9-Sep-2003 by Matthias Braun
-worked around issues with the block allocator code for Particl2D (new operator
 is overloaded, but laste C++ draft doesn't allow to return 0 from such an
 overloaded new.) I added exceptions and lots of try {} catch{} blocks, let's
 hope I didn't miss something.
-eleminated isValidPtr, Util.hpp and GOTTA_HAVE_IT from codewiz.hpp

8-Sep-2003 by Matthias Braun
-added some basic music plying support (all files in sfx/music are played in
		random order, so simply put some .mp3 or .ogg there)
-enabled Tile engine code again
-fixed some bugs in the blitting routines
-fixed some more small bugs I introduced while porting
-Added new keyboard handling code
-fixed lots of code that assumed a key scancode is "only" a char
-added possibility to switch windows/fullscreen mode on ALT+ENTER
-fixed some smaller bugs in Splitpath and FileUtil
-added an fps counter to the info window
-lots of small fixes in the network code
-applied a patch from Raphael Bosshard which fixes a few warnings

7-Sep-2003 by Matthias Braun
-removed NetMessageLog class (because it only contained shit ;-)
-slightly changed NetworkServer and NetworkClient interfaces
-Added a SDL_Net version of the network code
-cleaned up socket code alot, by removing all this UDP code (a complete new
 and clean network code will be needed sometime anyway...)
-more cleanup in the network code
-added a client version of the SDLNet code
-replaced all FUBARs with throw Exception, so I could remove terminate.cpp

6-Sep-2003 by Matthias Braun
-added a unix implementation of _findfirst, _findnext and _findclose
-removed some getDrive functions, was never used and supporting drives in unix
 is hard :)
-we still need a big commit to replace all \\ in paths with /
-added a fastly hacked configure script (no autoconf yet)
-randomly replaced some \\ in pathnames with /
-More news on my crusade against codewiz.hpp:
  *removed some unused stuff from codewiz.hpp and terminate.cpp
  *added new but alot simpler logging functions to Log.hpp
-replaced all \\ in paths with / (gotta love sed). Yes, I made sure that I only
 change paths (I looked at the list of stuff I change, before applying the sed
 command)
-added Stub for SDLSound implementation
-added a basic SDL Event loop
-fixed more small issues
=> the main menu is displayed now and the Exit and Options buttons work :)
-added a unix verison of _splitpath
-some code cleanups:
 *removed JoystickInterface completely
 *removed netPanzerGlobals.*
 *removed netPanzerMain.*

------------
prior changes (not complete)
............

-Added very basic makefile
-removed #include "Stdafx.h" from all source files, gcc doesn't have precompiled
 headers like msvc.
-Added some missing include in several files
-Removed strange double-include protection from codewiz.hpp
-Removed DOS-compilation stuff from codewiz.hpp
-Renamed TRUE to true, FALSE to false, BOOL to bool and removed the definitions
 for them from codewiz.hpp
-Removed BYTE,WORD,DWORD definitions from codewiz.hpp these are already defined
 in Types/LibTypes.hpp
-Commented memset assembler routines in codewiz.hpp
-removed special WATCOM/MSVC #pragmas in lots of places in codewiz.hpp
-changed type of PALETTE_LENGTH to size_t
-added a SWAP function to codewiz.hpp, couldn't find one elsewhere in the
 project. Also added a SWAP function with an explicit temporary variable which
 is used at some places in the project (does this bring speed?)
-made destructor of Surface, Component, SpritePacked virtual
-changed usage of zeroMem to memset
-use memcpy instead of memcpyB
-Added a stub of RDTSC function to cTimeStamp.cpp, need an implementation there.
-Added a dummy GameTemplateView.hpp. Needs investigation why the Lib includes
 files from the main game.
-copied KeyScanCodeDefs.h from main game
-removed #if _MSC_VER > 1000 #pragma once #endif randomly from several files...
-removed /= (const float&) in fXYZ class (/= (float) is enough)
-gave up with the Lib/Main Game dependencies and added include paths to the main
game in the Makefiles...
-removed "aliasdef.h" from several files (it contained yet another definition of
  a boolean type...), several renames again :-/
-added int return type to getUnitInfoDrawLayer in GameConfig
-changed iRect constructor to use const types
-disabled all joystick code
-casted several floats to ints in ColorTable.cpp to avoid warnings
-Commented out several uses of _splitpath (which is win32 only) at FileList.cpp
-fixed some upper/lowercase errors in #include statements
-commented out code that uses _findfirst in Surface.cpp and PackedSurface.cpp,
 this is a win32 only function
-casted some floats to int in Palette.cpp to avoid warnings
-commented out several assembler routines in Span.cpp
-removed custom memcpy from Surface.cpp
-changed a MessageBox to fprintf(stderr, ...) in Surface.cpp
-added implementation of MIN and MAX to codewiz.hpp
-renamed stricmp to strcasecmp in UtilInterface.cpp
-made some functions in SpritePacked and Sprite const-correct
-commented out lots of code in DirtKickParticle2D, because a variable didn't
seem to be defined. Did teh same in GroundExplosionParticle
-some more const-correctness fixes in GroundExplosionParticle and
TrajectoryParticle.
-made some functions in WorldViewInterface const-correct, same in ViewCamera
-commented out some direct sound code in ParticleInterface.cpp
-renamed some occurences of NULL to 0 in ParticleSystem2D
-commented out isRolloverEnabled in AbstractButton.hpp, this variable doesn't
seem to exist.
-removed Lib/loadSaveData.* it wasn't used (some joystick stuff, we wanna remove
		the joystick anyway).
