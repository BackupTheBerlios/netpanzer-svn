This is a prerelease open for public testing. Especiacially the new ppc code is
not tested yet. I'd be happy about some feedback if it works or not
(matze@braunis.de).

  browser (also next xqf version will support netpanzer)

  webpages

  addresses and eleminates a dependency)

  properly parsed.

*** 0.1.4 ***

Some small feature additions. Unfortunatley we changed the network protocol
again, so servers and clients should get updated soon. There's a bug in the old
0.1.3 server code that makes it crash when a 0.1.4 client connects.
                                                                                
    * It's possible to configure the mapcycle in the server
    * Players now have colors on the radar (thanks Viras)
    * small fixes to make netpanzer run on win32
    * a new quickconnect option for the commandline (usefull for external server      browsers like KNetpanzerbrowser
