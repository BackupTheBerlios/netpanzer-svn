    This is a preliminary version of the netpanzer server howto. Feedback and
    improvement to the scripts, tips&amp;tricks are apreciated. Please send them
    to <ulink url="mailto:matze@braunis.de">matze@braunis.de</ulink>.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="Installation">
    <title>Installation</title>
    <para>
The server comes with the normal netpanzer package, look into the README there
on how to install netpanzer.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="Configuration">
    <title>Configuration</title>
    <para>
You can find the server configuration file in your homedirectory in
.netpanzer/config/netpanzer-dedicated.ini. If this file doesn't exist yet, start
your server once and quit (by using the quit command) and a file should have
been created. You can find a description of all config commands in the
netpanzer README.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="firewalls">
      <title>Firewalls</title>
      <para>
If your server is using a firewall, then you have to forward port 3030 TCP+UDP.
You can change this port with the port setting in the config file.
      </para>

  <sect1 id="scripts">
    <title>Startscripts and Tools</title>
    <sect2 id="autorestart">
      <title>Restart on crash</title>
      <para>
Unfortunatley the netpanzer server is not as stable yet as it should be. So you
should install a script that restarts the server automatically in case of a
crash. This can be achieved with the following script (called
<filename>start-netpanzer-dedicated.sh</filename>).
      </para>
      <para>
        <programlisting role="sh">
#!/bin/bash

# insert the directory of the server binary here
DIR=.

cd $DIR
running=yes
while [ $running = "yes" ]; do
    ./netpanzer -d $@
    if [ $? -ge 128 ]; then
        echo "`date`: Restarting server after crash"
        # wait a bit to not blow cpu and logfiles on constant crashs
        sleep 30
    else
        #normal exit
        running=no
    fi
done
        </programlisting>
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="Screen">
      <title>Screen</title>
      <para>
Typically you don't always want to monitor your server in a terminal window.
Also in case your monitoring terminal terminates the server is normally stopped
too. To solve these problems there's a handy little tool called
<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">Screen</ulink> that allows
you to run your applications in a virtual terminal to which you can
attach/detach at any time.
      </para>
      <para>
So typically you write another script with your startup parameters like this
(Also take a look at the Security Warning at the end of this document for the
 commented variants)
        <programlisting role="sh">
#!/bin/bash

# insert the directory of the start-netpanzer-dedicated.sh here 
DIR=.

cd $DIR

# starts the server in a screen. Please consider using 1 of the 2 variants below
# for increased secutiry
screen -A -m -d -S netpanzer ./start-netpanzer-dedicated.sh $@

# This version switches to a more secure user account
# screen -A -m -d -S netpanzer su - netpserver -c "./start-netpanzer-dedicated.sh $@"

# This version starts the server in a chroot environment and with a different
# user for even more security
screen -A -m -d -S netpanzer chroot /home/netpserver su - netpserver -c "./start-netpanzer-dedicated.sh $@"
        </programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
You can attach to this virtual netpanzer terminal by typing
<command>screen -r netpanzer</command>. You can detach again by pressing
CTRL+A and then CTRL+D. See the Screen documentation for details.
      </para>                                                                 
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="integration">
    <title>Integration into the system</title>
    <para>
Often you want to further integrate the server into your system so that it is
automatically started on startup and checked on a regular basis.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="initscripts">
      <title>Init Scripts</title>
      <para>Most linux and bsd systems come with an init script system that
      takes care of starting and stopping services on the system. Creating such
      initscripts is distribution specific, so I just present the script for
      gentoo here as an example:
        <programlisting role="sh">
#!/sbin/runscripts

depend() {
    need net
}

start() {
    ebegin "Starting netpanzer server"
    start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --pidfile /var/run/netpanzer.pid --exec /usr/local/scripts/netpanzer-screen.sh --pidfile=/var/run/netpanzer.pid
    eend $
}

stop() {
    ebegin "Stopping netpanzer server"
    start-stop-daemon --stop --quiet --pidfile /var/run/netpanzer.pid
    eedn $?
}
        </programlisting>
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="cron">
      <title>Cron Jobs</title>
      <para>If you can't integrate the server into the initscripts of your
      system (if you have only a useraccount for example) then you can use cron
      to make sure your server stays running even after system restarts. You
      should write another script that checks for a running server and
      eventually restarts it (called
              <filename>check-netpanzer-server.sh</filename>
      <programlisting role="sh">
#!/bin/sh

procs=`/bin/ps`
if echo "$procs" | grep netpanzer > /dev/null; then
    exit
fi

# start netpanzer server
cd /usr/local/scripts
./netpanzer-screen.sh
      </programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
You should start this script regularily in a cronjob. By adding the following
line in your crontab (type <command>crontab -e</command> to edit your crontab).
This will check the server every hour (54 minutes after the full hour) to make
sure it is still running. 
        <programlisting role="sh">
# min hour day month dayofweek command
54 * * * * /bin/sh /usr/local/scripts/check-netpanzer-server.sh
        </programlisting>
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="security">
    <title>Security Warning</title>
    <para>
The code of the server hasn't undergone an in depth review for secutiry holes
yet, so you should expect the possibility that attackers can find buffer
overflows to obtain control over the netpanzer executable and the user account
the server is running. (Experience shows that this also happens with other
servers that claim to be secure...).
    </para>
    <para>
Therefore it is recommended to run the server in a special useraccount with
limited rights. On linux/bsd you should also consider using a chroot
environment for increased security. Consult external documentation about
details. The screen startup script shown above also demonstrates in a comment
how to do this with the su and chroot commands.
