Some words on the used coding standards:

Formating:
-Indentation is done with 4 spaces, tabs are not allowed
-braces are used like this:

class SomeClass
{
public:
    void someFunction()
    {
        if(foo) {
            // ...
        } else {
            // ...
        }

        while(bar) {
            // ...
        }
    }
};
-classnames are written LikeThis and This
-member and attributenames are written likeThis and this
-documentating comments are written in doxygen format
-A single .hpp and .cpp only contains declarations/implementations for 1 class,
 the filename is the same as the classname

Code:
-We only use libraries that claim to be portable to at least windows, linux and
 MacOS/X
-We use modern c++ standards where possible. This includes:
    namespaces, RTTI, exceptions, iostreams, STL
