-Fix or completely remove the Joystick code. (IMO we should remove it, because
 controling this game with joystick isn't a good idea) - OK
-Fix FileList.cpp to use only ANSI-C functions, so that we don't need the win32
 _splitpath anymore. The same is in UtilInterface.cpp - OK
-Fix PackedSurface.cpp, Surface.cpp to not use _findfirst anymore... same in
 MapsManager.cpp - OK
-Write new timercode the assembler cTimeStamp.cpp isn't portable - OK
-Write new code instead of the assembler in Span.cpp and Surface.cpp - OK
  (though this could be speed optimized a bit more...)
-ParticleInterface.cpp contains some DirectSound code which needs to be replaced
 - OK
-GroundExplosionParticle, RadarPingParticle2D and DirtKickParticle2D seem to
 miss some Surface variables, where are these defined? - seems OK
-PUFF_PARTICLE_TYPE isn't defined in SmokingTrajectoryParticle - Old code? -
    yes, OK
-write a new version of DDHardSurface - OK
-network code probably needs a bigger rewrite since directplay is not available
 on unix. - OK (for now)
-look at all the directx code in GameManager.cpp - OK
-need new mousecode in MouseInterface.cpp - OK
-need new directplay code in NetworkClientDPlay.cpp, NetworkServerDPlay.cpp -
  not needed, these files aren't used anymore - OK
-need new code instead of winsock in NetworkClientWinsock.cpp - OK
-rewrite all the windows specific code in NetPanzer/Core - OK (SDL specific
 code is in NetPanze/Core/unix now)
-check if the functions and stuff in Lib/terminate.cpp is really needed (looks
 like some strange hacks for the logging functions to me) Can we remove
 this strange code? - Yes we can :) OK
-Fix the win32 stuff in Lib/Util/UtilInterface.cpp - OK
-rewrite win32 event loop to use a SDL event loop. Don't forget to pump mouse
 events to MouseInterface then. - OK

Todo before beta release:
-Fix the problems with mainmenu in >640x480 resolution
-Eventually trim down option windows to only necessary stuff (this can wait
    for after the release though)
-Complete GameConfig::save and GameConfig::load functions
-Test it (esp. with more than 2 players)
-Make it compiling in mingw again.
-Fix all warnings in the sourcecode
-Add configure script (autoconf) which checks for all prerequesits
-Create "make install" target (also a "make uninstall"?)
-Write a README
-Test it, esp. with more than 2 players and test a complete
    getsource/configure/build/install/play cycle. We should be able to find
    betatesters in irc channels like #netpanzer, #sdl, #*game* I assume ;-)
-Create and upload source tarball
-Announce on linux/opensource related sites (together with a call for new
    artists, coders, and *good* game designers - we wanna improve the gameplay
    too, don't we?)
