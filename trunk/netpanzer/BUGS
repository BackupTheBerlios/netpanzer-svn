- cursor scroll is always same speed, should use scrollrate
- when a client connect to a server, it will save the configuration that
  the server sent to him when exit netpanzer.
- sometimes 2 players spawn at the same place - hard to fix, low priority
- it is reported that in timelimit mode games might end too early (ie. client
  display 40/60 and game ends) - is it possible that the client time doesn't
  sync correctly with server time?
- Astar sometimes calculates strange paths. Very obvious if you try to capture
  and outpost from the left side: Your panzers will drive around it before
  entering it. (it is not a complete Astar, needs to rewrite)
- The no allies flag in the server config has no effect
- Clients pressing the Abort button when connecting leave a ghost on the server
which displays no IP. (i think matze fixed this in 0.8.1)
- The Abort button when connecting doesn't really aborts the operation, just hide the window
-netpanzer fails on win98se
-setting allowallies=no in config has no effect

-NOTE: next error would be cause by previously fixed error (maybe, lets see in future)
<BenUrban> have you encountered either of the pantom tank bugs yet MatzeB ?
<MatzeB> nope
<BenUrban> there's one where an actual tank is really there (apparently) but
just not visible in the client
<MatzeB> how do you know it's there then?
<BenUrban> my own tanks shoot at it
<MatzeB> and it explodes when you shoot long enough on it?
<BenUrban> i think so
<xpanthom> the cvs link on berlios is dead, what's the link with svn?
<BenUrban> not sure though
* BenUrban points out that netpanzer doesn't use cvs at all
<xpanthom> it apparently has at some point...
<BenUrban> the other bug occurs when someone unexpectedly disconnects
<BenUrban> the positions that their tanks occupied become unavailable
<BenUrban> until the next server rest
<BenUrban> or map change
<BenUrban> that one is far more common
<BenUrban> and has been known to block off bases completely
<MatzeB> oh
