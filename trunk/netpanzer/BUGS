- Astar priority_queue "open" are not clear anytime - can't reproduce
- in LinkListDoubleTemplate.addFront sometime is (front==0 && rear != 0)
    - Matze: I checked LinkListDoubleTemplate alot, the class seems to be
      correct. Most probably the memory corruption happens elsewhere
- the lobby views disappears when you switch to options menu and back - party
  fixed, after a connection error the lobby view still isn't visible anymore
  - seems fixed
- when the bot occupied an outpost and you occupy it back, then the build menu
  shows the panzer you built last, but the one choosen by the bot comes out the
  outpost
- sometimes 2 players spawn at the same place - hard to fix, low priority
- game doesn't end when enough objectives are taken - is this still true?
- irc ping/pong code with reconnect seems to be broken
- unit count is calculated incorrect (20 in server config - 9 units 
  available in game) - the unit count is simply hardcoded, it's not
  configurable yet
- If you change your username and connect to the server, then you'll still
  have your old username until you leave the game.
