- Astar priority_queue "open" are not clear anytime - can't reproduce
- in LinkListDoubleTemplate.addFront sometime is (front==0 && rear != 0)
    - Matze: I checked LinkListDoubleTemplate alot, the class seems to be
      correct. Most probably the memory corruption happens elsewhere
- the lobby views disappears when you switch to options menu and back - party
  fixed, after a connection error the lobby view still isn't visible anymore
- when the bot occupied an outpost and you occupy it back, then the build menu
  shows the panzer you built last, but the one choosen by the bot comes out the
  outpost
- sometimes 2 players spawn at the same place
- game doesn't end when enough objectives are taken - is this still true?
- irc ping/pong code with reconnect seems to be broken
