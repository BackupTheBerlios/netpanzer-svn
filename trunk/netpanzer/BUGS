- Astar priority_queue "open" are not clear anytime - can't reproduce
- in LinkListDoubleTemplate.addFront sometime is (front==0 && rear != 0)
    - Matze: I checked LinkListDoubleTemplate alot, the class seems to be
      correct. Most probably the memory corruption happens elsewhere
- sometimes 2 players spawn at the same place - hard to fix, low priority
- unit count is calculated incorrect (20 in server config - 9 units 
  available in game) - the unit count is simply hardcoded, it's not
  configurable yet
- it is reported that in timelimit mode games might end too early (ie. client
  display 40/60 and game ends) - is it possible that the client time doesn't
  sync correctly with server time?
- Astar sometimes calculates strange paths. Very obvious if you try to capture
  and outpost from the left side: Your panzers will drive around it before
  entering it.
- Clients aren't notified when the server closes - actually they are, but they
  aren't shutting down the game
- you shouldn't get points for shooting your own units
