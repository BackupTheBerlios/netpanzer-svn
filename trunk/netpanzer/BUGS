- sometimes 2 players spawn at the same place - hard to fix, low priority
- unit count is calculated incorrect (20 in server config - 9 units 
  available in game) - the unit count is simply hardcoded, it's not
  configurable yet
- it is reported that in timelimit mode games might end too early (ie. client
  display 40/60 and game ends) - is it possible that the client time doesn't
  sync correctly with server time?
- Astar sometimes calculates strange paths. Very obvious if you try to capture
  and outpost from the left side: Your panzers will drive around it before
  entering it.
- Clients aren't notified when the server closes - actually they are, but they
  aren't shutting down the game
- The no allies flag in the server config has no effect
- Clients pressing the Abort button when connecting leave a ghost on the server
which displays no IP.
-netpanzer fails on win98se
-setting allowallies=no in config has no effect
[22:43:23]      <BenUrban>      woohoo
[22:43:26]      <BenUrban>      caught SIGABRT
[22:43:30]      <BenUrban>      in debugger :D
[22:45:17]      <BenUrban>      UnitInterface::offloadGraphics(SpriteSorter &)...
[22:45:41]      <BenUrban>      UnitInterface.cpp:274
[22:45:59]      <BenUrban>      t->unit->offloadGraphics(sorter);
[22:50:47]      <BenUrban>      Program received signal:  "SIGABRT".
[22:50:47]      <BenUrban>      pure virtual method called
[22:50:49]      <BenUrban>      SIGH
[23:04:46]      <BenUrban>      virtual void offloadGraphics(SpriteSorter& ) = 0;
[23:04:47]      <BenUrban>      hmm
[23:05:05]      *       BenUrban wonders if there's an easy way to inspect what class this particular object is
[23:06:28]      <BenUrban>      hmm
[23:06:34]      <BenUrban>      it says it's a UnitBase object
[23:07:02]      <BenUrban>      of unit_type 2...
[23:11:02]      <BenUrban>      hmm
[23:11:13]      <BenUrban>      it must be an actual UnitBase object
[23:11:26]      <BenUrban>      since the only direct subclass of UnitBase is Vehicle
[23:11:39]      <BenUrban>      and that does have an offloadGraphics method
[23:11:42]      <BenUrban>      so...
[23:11:45]      <BenUrban>      the question...
[23:11:59]      <BenUrban>      is why did the compilet allow it to create a UnitBase object?
[23:12:04]      <BenUrban>      *compiler
[23:12:07]      <BenUrban>      hmm
[23:12:18]      <BenUrban>      and where did it create it?
[23:16:29]      <BenUrban>      hmm
[23:27:09]      <BenUrban>      looks like it's supposed to be a Titan
[23:41:58]      *       BenUrban exited the debugger


<BenUrban> have you encountered either of the pantom tank bugs yet MatzeB ?
<MatzeB> nope
<BenUrban> there's one where an actual tank is really there (apparently) but
just not visible in the client
<MatzeB> how do you know it's there then?
<BenUrban> my own tanks shoot at it
<MatzeB> and it explodes when you shoot long enough on it?
<BenUrban> i think so
<xpanthom> the cvs link on berlios is dead, what's the link with svn?
<BenUrban> not sure though
* BenUrban points out that netpanzer doesn't use cvs at all
<xpanthom> it apparently has at some point...
<BenUrban> the other bug occurs when someone unexpectedly disconnects
<BenUrban> the positions that their tanks occupied become unavailable
<BenUrban> until the next server rest
<BenUrban> or map change
<BenUrban> that one is far more common
<BenUrban> and has been known to block off bases completely
<MatzeB> oh

- setting maxunits so low that no player can spawn with 9 units makes netpanzer
  trigger an assertion, should be an error message
