- still SIGSEGV when client disconnect - fixed
- does not display unit pictures in factory - fixed
- objective game cannot finish - fixed
- HOM effect outside the progressview window -fixed
- Astar priority_queue "open" are not clear anytime
- in LinkListDoubleTemplate.addFront sometime is (front==0 && rear != 0)
- the lobby views disappears when you switch to options menu and back
- when the bot occupied an outpost and you occupy it back, then the build menu
  shows the panzer you built last, but the one choosen by the bot comes out the
  outpost
