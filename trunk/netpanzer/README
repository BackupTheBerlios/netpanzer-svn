1. Introduction
netPanzer is an online multiplayer tactical warfare game designed for FAST
ACTION combat. Gameplay concentrates on the core -- no resource management is
needed. The game is based on quick tactical action and unit management in
real-time. Battles progress quickly and constantly as destroyed players respawn
with a set of new units. Players can join or leave multiplayer games at any
time.

1.1 A bit of history
The original development of netpanzer was done from PyroSoft inc. Though in
1999 they stop development and released the game 2002 in GPL and it was nearly
forgotten, until Ingo announce it at tux game tome. Soon after this announcement
a group of coders did the linux port in roughly 2 weeks, with another 2 weeks
polishing for this release. Now we'll go along and improve the game...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2. Building and Installation

2.1 Prerequesites
The game depends on some tools and libraries to be present, before you can start
building it. Here's a list of them:

* normal gnu compiler and additional tools (g++ version 3.2 or later is
  required at the moment)

* perforce jam 2.5 or later (used as build tool)
  ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/jam

* SDL 1.2.5 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org

* SDL_net 1.2.4 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/

* SDL_mixer 1.2.4 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

* SDL_image 1.2.3 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

* SDL_ttf 2.0.0 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

* PhysicsFS 0.1.9 or later
  http://www.icculus.org/physfs/

Thanks to all the authors of these helpful libraries that made our development
easy and straightforward.

2.2 Building

To build and install the game use the following commands:

./configure
jam
 (You probably need to be root for the installation, so using "su" is a good
  idea here)
jam install

The configure script also lets you set some more options like the installation
directory (--prefix argument). You'll get a full list of these if you invoke
"configure --help". The game should be installed now.

2.3 Music

Netpanzer doesn't come with own musicfiles yet. However you can place your
favourite .mp3, .ogg or .mod files into the sound/music directory and netpanzer
will play these in random order while you play.

2.4 Starting the game

You can start the game by typing

netpanzer

Note that on first startup the game needs some time to precalculate some data.
This might take up to 5 minutes. So just wait a bit when you have a black
screen.

3. Gameplay

This section needs to be written... Use the Help button in the game for now or
trust your intuition :)

4. Dedicated Server and Configuration Files

You can start a dedicated netpanzer server (a pure server, without any video
output). By starting netpanzer with the -d commandline option.

The server reads the configuration from
    $HOME/.netpanzer/config/netpanzer-dedicated.xml
. The format is basically the same as the normal configuration file of
netpanzer. Here's a short introduction into the option specific to a server in
the server section of the xml file:

*serverport [number], default 3030
    Specifies the port which the server will be using. (The server is using the
    TCP protocol)

*maxplayers [number], default 8
    Number of players and bots that are able to play simultaneously on the
    server.

*mapcycle [name], default "Cramped, Tight Quarters, Two Villages"
    A comma separated list of maps that this server will use.

*maxunits [number], default 500
    Number of maximum available units for all players. (Each
            player will be able to have maxplayers/maxunits units at once)
    
*initialunits [number], default 5
    Number of units that each player starts with when he joins or after he's
    been killed.

*gametype [0,1,2], default 0
    Type of game: (0=Objectives, 1=FragLimit, 2=TimeLimit)

*timelimit [number], default 50
    timelimit of the map in minutes (used when gametype = 2)

*fraglimit [number], default 500
    fraglimit of the map (used when gametype=1)

*objectivepercentage [number], default 50
    Percentage of outposts that has to be captured to win the game.
    (used when gametype=0)

*mapcycling [yes,no], default no
    cycle to next map after a map ended. (Currently not working correctly...)

*poweups [yes,no], default yes
    enable/disable powerups

*allowallies [yes,no], default yes
    allow/disallow players to allie

*cloudcoverage [number], default 65
    Number of clouds flying over the map.

5. Bot Players

Netpanzer provides a bot player for these times when you don't have a human
opponent. You can start netpanzer in a special mode where it connects to a
server and simulates a real player. You can start netpanzer like this to connect
as bot to a server:

netpanzer -b servername

Example:
This example shows how you can play locally against 2 bots:

netpanzer -d &
netpanzer -b localhost &
netpanzer -b localhost &
netpanzer

... now press multiplayer and join to server address localhost ...
