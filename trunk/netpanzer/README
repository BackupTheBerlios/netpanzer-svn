1. Introduction
netPanzer is an online multiplayer tactical warfare game designed for play
across the Internet and over LAN systems. netPanzer is designed for FAST ACTION
combat -- it is not another resource management clone. In fact, there aren't
any resources at all. Each player will have many units of different types at
their disposal. Players can fight until their units are destroyed -- then
respawn and keep on going. The game is real-time, but it's based on quick
tactical action and unit management. Battles progress quickly and constantly;
in fact, they never let up. There is no stop in the action because there is no
waiting for resources to be collected and converted into weaponry. Players can
join or leave multiplayer games at any time.

1.1 A bit of history
The original development of netpanzer was done from PyroSoft inc. Though in
1999 they stop development and released the game 2002 in GPL and it was nearly
forgotten, until Ingo announce it at tux game tome. Soon after this announcement
a group of coders did the linux port in roughly 2 weeks, with another 2 weeks
polishing for this release. Now we'll go along and improve the game...

2. Building and Installation

2.1 Prerequesites
The game depends on some tools and libraries to be present, before you can start
building it. Here's a list of them:

* normal gnu compiler and additional tools (g++ version 3.2 or later is
  required at the moment)

* perforce jam 2.5 or later (used as build tool)
  ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/jam

* SDL 1.2.5 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org

* SDL_net 1.2.4 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/

* SDL_mixer 1.2.4 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

* SDL_image 1.2.3 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

* PhysicsFS 0.1.9 or later
  http://www.icculus.org/physfs/

Thanks to all the authors of these helpful libraries that made our development
easy and straightforward.

2.2 Building

To build and install the game use the following commands:

./configure
jam
 (You probably need to be root for the installation, so using "su" is a good
  idea here)
jam install

The configure script also lets you set some more options like the installation
directory (--prefix argument). You'll get a full list of these if you invoke
"configure --help". The game should be installed now.

2.3 Music

Netpanzer doesn't come with own musicfiles yet. However you can place your
favourite .mp3, .ogg or .mod files into the sound/music directory and netpanzer
will play these in random order while you play.

2.4 Starting the game

You can start the game by typing

netpanzer

a dedicated server can be started with

netpanzer -d

trust your intuition :)
