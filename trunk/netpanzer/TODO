*** Lobby Code
- Dedicated server always try to announce themself on the netpanzer lobby. User
  should be able to disable this. - implemented
- Non-Dedicated servers don't announce themselfes at the lobby.
- There's no check if the irc-server connection is still available. We should
  use some ping/pong messages there.
- the player nickname is often already used by someone else in irc. We should
  add a netpanzer postfix to them. (ie. MatzeB|netp). If you try to use the name
  of another netpanzer player, then you should be warned and given a chance to
  reconnect with another name
- It should be possible to use different ports than the default one for the
  netpanzer server

*** Improvements
-let dedicated server output statistics on console at the end of a round
-Convert the 256 color stuff to truecolor
-Add timeout/keepalive handling to network layer to correctly detect connection
 losses and try reconnects
-impelement 'initialunits' param in PlayerUnitConfig::initialize()
-bots should have different names and different flags
-the collection of flags has to be the same on all clients at the moment. This
should be changed (clients should send the name of their flag). The collest
solution would be transfering of unknown flags.

*** Tools
-write a map and tileset editor
-tool for changing the (server?) configuration

*** Feature Additions

-Improve userinterface:
        * Make usual shortcuts (known from other RTSes) work. Like
          CTRL+number for defining groups, a possibility to set spawnpoint
          of units, scroll map with right mouse, scrolling map with cursor keys
          ...
        * Create a nice static! skin which is at the bottom of the screen
          and combines a map, statusdisplay of selected units and outpost
          buildmenu
        * Redesign menus and UI code (use new font code, sfont or freefont
          maybe?)
-Build additional tools:
        * Build a map and tileset editor (That's what I'm up to at the
          moment)
-Create possibilities to save and play replays of the matches
-Create possibility to save and restore matches
-Convert the 256 color stuff to truecolor
-add code for masterserver registration/browsing
-create UDP broadcast code for announcing servers in LANs
-make it possible to configure the mapcycle
-add a (readline based?) serverconsole
