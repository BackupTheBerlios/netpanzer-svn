*** Lobby Code
- Dedicated server always try to announce themself on the netpanzer lobby. User
  should be able to disable this. - implemented
- Non-Dedicated servers don't announce themselfes at the lobby. - implemented
- There's no check if the irc-server connection is still available. We should
  use some ping/pong messages there. - implemented
- the player nickname is often already used by someone else in irc. We should
  add a netpanzer postfix to them. (ie. MatzeB|netp). If you try to use the name
  of another netpanzer player, then you should be warned and given a chance to
  reconnect with another name - implemented
- It should be possible to use different ports than the default one for the
  netpanzer server - implemented

*** Improvements
-let dedicated server output statistics on console at the end of a round
-Convert the 256 color stuff to truecolor
-Add timeout/keepalive handling to network layer to correctly detect connection
 losses and try reconnects
-impelement 'initialunits' param in PlayerUnitConfig::initialize()
-bots should have different names and different flags
-the collection of flags has to be the same on all clients at the moment. This
should be changed (clients should send the name of their flag). The collest
solution would be transfering of unknown flags.
-the unit profiles should be possible to set on the server. They should be
distributed to the clients while they connect.
-limit fps to a fixed value so that we are nicer to the CPU on the system.
-make it possible to have different colors for different players - DONE
-make the code endian safe. It should run on big endian boxes too.

*** Tools
-write a map and tileset editor
-tool for changing the (server?) configuration

*** Feature Additions

-Improve userinterface:
        * Make usual shortcuts (known from other RTSes) work. Like
          CTRL+number for defining groups, a possibility to set spawnpoint
          of units, scroll map with right mouse, scrolling map with cursor keys
          ...
        * Create a nice static! skin which is at the bottom of the screen
          and combines a map, statusdisplay of selected units and outpost
          buildmenu
        * Redesign menus and UI code (use new font code, sfont or freefont
          maybe?)
-Build additional tools:
        * Build a map and tileset editor (That's what I'm up to at the
          moment)
-Create possibilities to save and play replays of the matches
-Create possibility to save and restore matches
-Convert the 256 color stuff to truecolor
-add code for masterserver registration/browsing
-create UDP broadcast code for announcing servers in LANs
-make it possible to configure the mapcycle
-add a (readline based?) serverconsole
-add possibilty for setting waypoints (ALT+leftclick?)

*** gameplay
Note that these are just random idea. We should be very careful when tuning the
gameplay. 1 of the strengths of netpanzer is that it is simple to understand
andplay. We should try hard not to destroy this by adding too many options.

-Add a mode where nothing is produced (maps without outposts). Players can
 select some tanks based on a points system and can then fight with this fixed
 amount of tanks
-Add different types of outposts. (only selected types of panzers, possibility
        to repair units at helipad, ...)
-Add possibilities to repair units (helipad at outpost or repair tank)
-Add fog of war (eventually with special things like radar jammers or radar
        tanks?)
-add infantry? anti-tank style ones, and anti-infantry ones?
-different terrain types (some terrain where you can move slower) maybe also
 with a heightmap.
-more map elements? bridges that can be destroyed (and repaired?)
-a unit that can deploy mines
-special game modes and objectives? capture the flag or "escort a VIP", or
 defend an objective would be things that come to mind
-make panzers always hit their targets instead of missing moving units?
