Todo before beta release:
-Fix the problems with mainmenu in >640x480 resolution - OK
-Eventually trim down option windows to only necessary stuff (this can wait
    for after the release though) - OK
-Complete GameConfig::save and GameConfig::load functions
-Test it (esp. with more than 2 players)
-Make it compiling in mingw again. - droped from my side, if noone volunteers
 then this release will be unix only... (I really tried with cygwin, but got
 bored since I didn't even manage to compile physfs and SDL_mixer correctly)
-Fix all warnings in the sourcecode - OK
-Add configure script (autoconf) which checks for all prerequesits - OK
-Create "make install" target (also a "make uninstall"?) - OK (jam system now)
-Write a README
-Test it, esp. with more than 2 players and test a complete
    getsource/configure/build/install/play cycle. We should be able to find
    betatesters in irc channels like #netpanzer, #sdl, #*game* I assume ;-)
-Create and upload source tarball
-Announce on linux/opensource related sites (together with a call for new
    artists, coders, and *good* game designers - we wanna improve the gameplay
    too, don't we?)
