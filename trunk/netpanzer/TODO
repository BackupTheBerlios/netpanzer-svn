-Improve userinterface:
        * Make usual shortcuts (known from other RTSes) work. Like
          CTRL+number for defining groups, a possibility to set spawnpoint
          of units, scroll map with right mouse, ...
        * Create a nice static! skin which is at the bottom of the screen
          and combines a map, statusdisplay of selected units and outpost
          buildmenu
        * Redesign menus and UI code (use new font code, sfont or freefont
          maybe?)
-Build additional tools:
        * Build a map and tileset editor (That's what I'm up to at the
          moment)
-Create possibilities to save and play replays of the matches
-Create possibility to save and restore matches
-Convert the 256 color stuff to truecolor
-add code for masterserver registration/browsing
