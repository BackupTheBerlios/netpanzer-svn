*** Lobby Code
-use new more stable IRC code from Lib/IRC

*** Improvements
-let dedicated server output statistics on console or in some log files. So that
 you can generate nice html pages with statistics of the players :)
-Convert the 256 color stuff to truecolor
-Add timeout/keepalive handling to network layer to correctly detect connection
 losses and try reconnects (we should think about this again, doesn't TCP
 already do similar things?)
-impelement 'initialunits' param in PlayerUnitConfig::initialize()
-bots should have different names and different flags - partly implemented
-the collection of flags has to be the same on all clients at the moment. This
should be changed (clients should send the name of their flag). The collest
solution would be transfering of unknown flags.
-make it possible to have different colors for different players - DONE
-make the code endian safe. It should run on big endian boxes too.
-display alliances in the status screens.

*** Tools
-write a map and tileset editor
-tool for changing the (server?) configuration

*** Feature Additions

-Display tip of the day while loading the map.
-Improve userinterface:
        * Make usual shortcuts (known from other RTSes) work:
            -CTRL+Number for defining groups - done
            -Scroll map with right mouse - done
            -scrolling map with cursor keys
            -Space jumps to last action - done
            -a key to cycle through all (offline) outposts
            -add possibilty for setting waypoints (ALT+leftclick?)
            -...
        * Create a nice static! skin which is at the bottom of the screen
          and combines a map, statusdisplay of selected units and outpost
          buildmenu
        * Redesign menus and UI code (use new font code, sfont or freefont
          maybe?)
-Build additional tools:
        * Build a map and tileset editor (That's what I'm up to at the
          moment)
-Create possibilities to save and play replays of the matches
-Create possibility to save and restore matches
-Convert the 256 color stuff to truecolor and eventually use opengl for
 displaying stuff.
-add code for masterserver registration/browsing (this would be additional to
        the irc lobby code, so that we could get integration into server
        browsing tools like xqf done eventually)
-create UDP broadcast code for announcing servers in LANs
-add a (readline based?) serverconsole

*** gameplay
Note that these are just random idea. We should be very careful when tuning the
gameplay. 1 of the strengths of netpanzer is that it is simple to understand
andplay. We should try hard not to destroy this by adding too many options.

-Add a mode where nothing is produced (maps without outposts). Players can
 select some tanks based on a points system and can then fight with this fixed
 amount of tanks
-Add different types of outposts. (only selected types of panzers, possibility
        to repair units at helipad, ...)
-Add possibilities to repair units (helipad at outpost or repair tank)
-Add fog of war (eventually with special things like radar jammers or radar
        tanks?)
-add infantry? anti-tank style ones, and anti-infantry ones?
-different terrain types (some terrain where you can move slower) maybe also
 with a heightmap.
-more map elements? bridges that can be destroyed (and repaired?)
-a unit that can deploy mines
-special game modes and objectives? capture the flag or "escort a VIP", or
 defend an objective would be things that come to mind
-make panzers always hit their targets instead of missing moving units?
