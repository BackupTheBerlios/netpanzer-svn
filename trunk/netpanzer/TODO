Next release:
-after having a full nodelist in A* the server is getting slow
-make 1024x768 default resolution - ok
-update server text (no knetpanzerbrowser anymore) - ok
-server status command returns wrong player names (seems to happen after sudden
        client disconnects)
-netpanzer fails on win98se
-win32 doesn't show time in serverlogs
-you can't move panzers around on ppc (also often connection errors on ppc:
        <cypmac> cyp@itouch:~$ netpanzer -c 194.167.156.7
        <cypmac> open /dev/sequencer: No such device
        <cypmac> netpanzer: src/NetPanzer/Interfaces/PlayerInterface.hpp:82:
        static PlayerState* PlayerInterface::getPlayerState(short unsigned int):
        Assertion `player_index < max_players' failed.
        <cypmac> Received signal SIGABRT(6)
        <cypmac> aborting and trying to shutdown.
        <cypmac> Abandon)

-this resulted in an endless loop in the server
<fEnIo> Connection lost of Client 64: Read error: Connection timed out.

*** New Masterserver code
 * add new options to only show servers which are not empty, with a certain map
   or where a certain player is playing.
 * Create UDP broadcast code for LAN games

*** Network

*** Server related
 * refactor bot code, so that it is possible to directly spawn bots at the
   server, after that we could easily add a "Skirmish" button to the main menu.
 * let dedicated server output statistics on console or in some log files. 
   Also all message should be outputted with timestamps.
   So that you can generate nice html pages with statistics of the players :)
    - done
 * the Server has a massive memory leak somewhere - might be fixed now
 * impelement 'initialunits' param in PlayerUnitConfig::initialize()
 * synchronize resources between server and clients, both should have same flags
   collection and map. Let them automatically download these things.
 * server console doesn't react really way with all the messages of players
   scrolling by...
*** Improvements   
 * Use gettext and translate netpanzer
 * Add special chars to functions displaying text that allow to set text
   color/style. (^ like in quake based games?)
 * Convert the 256 color stuff to truecolor, usage of opengl is probably a good
   idea.
 * bots should have different names and different flags - partly implemented
 * make it possible to have different colors for different players - DONE
 * display alliances in the status screens.
 * think about setting unit spawnpoint/opening outpost view. It's very hard to
   select units standing in your base because of the other 2 functions.

*** Tools
 * tool for changing the (server?) configuration

*** Feature Additions
 * Display tip of the day while loading the map.
 * Improve userinterface:
 * Make usual shortcuts (known from other RTSes) work:
  -CTRL+Number for defining groups - done
  -pressing a number twice to center screen on the group
  -Scroll map with right mouse - done
  -scrolling map with cursor keys
  -Space jumps to last action - done
  -a key to cycle through all (offline) outposts
  -add possibilty for setting waypoints (ALT+leftclick?)
  -add possibility to set markers for allies
  -double clicking on a unit marks all units of the same type on screen
    (tripple clicking marks all units of this type on the map?)
  -"subclassing" like in WC3: A key that cycles though different unit types in
   the currently selected group.
  - S key stops tanks

  -...
 * Display targets of marked panzers with lines (ie. a green line if the panzer
   is moving, a red line if it is attacking some point)
 * Create a nice static! skin which is at the bottom of the screen
   and combines a map, statusdisplay of selected units and outpost buildmenu
 * Redesign menus and UI code (use new font code, sfont or freefont maybe?)
 * Create possibilities to save and play replays of the matches
 * Create possibility to save and restore matches
 * Convert the 256 color stuff to truecolor and eventually use opengl for
   displaying stuff.
 * add an in-game console like in quake-like games

*** Graphics
 * pulsing circle on the radar at places where battle happens (bigger circle if
   heavier?)

*** GUI

*** gameplay
/ Note that these are just random ideas. We should be very careful when 
/ tuning the gameplay. 1 of the strengths of netpanzer is that it is simple 
/ to understand and play. We should try hard not to destroy this by adding 
/ too many options.
 * adjust points for killings tanks based, on their type. Killing a spahpanzer
   should get fewer points than killing a Titan.
 * Add a mode where nothing is produced (maps without outposts). Players can
   select some tanks based on a points system and can then fight with this fixed
   amount of tanks
 * Add different types of outposts. (only selected types of panzers, 
   possibility to repair units at helipad, ...)
 * Add possibilities to repair units (helipad at outpost or repair tank)
 * Add fog of war (eventually with special things like radar jammers 
   or radar tanks?)
 * add infantry? anti-tank style ones, and anti-infantry ones?
 * different terrain types (some terrain where you can move slower) maybe also
   with a heightmap.
 * more map elements? bridges that can be destroyed (and repaired?)
 * a unit that can deploy mines
 * special game modes and objectives? capture the flag or "escort a VIP", or
   defend an objective would be things that come to mind
 * make panzers always hit their targets instead of missing moving units?
