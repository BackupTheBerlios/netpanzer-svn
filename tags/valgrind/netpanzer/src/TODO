-Fix or completely remove the Joystick code. (IMO we should remove it, because
 controling this game with joystick isn't a good idea) - OK
-Fix FileList.cpp to use only ANSI-C functions, so that we don't need the win32
 _splitpath anymore. The same is in UtilInterface.cpp - OK
-Fix PackedSurface.cpp, Surface.cpp to not use _findfirst anymore... same in
 MapsManager.cpp - OK
-Write new timercode the assembler cTimeStamp.cpp isn't portable - OK
-Write new code instead of the assembler in Span.cpp and Surface.cpp - OK
  (though this could be speed optimized a bit more...)
-ParticleInterface.cpp contains some DirectSound code which needs to be replaced
 - OK
-GroundExplosionParticle, RadarPingParticle2D and DirtKickParticle2D seem to
 miss some Surface variables, where are these defined?
-PUFF_PARTICLE_TYPE isn't defined in SmokingTrajectoryParticle - Old code?
-write a new version of DDHardSurface - OK
-network code probably needs a bigger rewrite since directplay is not available
 on unix.
-look at all the directx code in GameManager.cpp - OK
-need new mousecode in MouseInterface.cpp - OK
-need new directplay code in NetworkClientDPlay.cpp, NetworkServerDPlay.cpp -
  not needed, these files aren't used anymore
-need new code instead of winsock in NetworkClientWinsock.cpp - nearl OK
-rewrite all the windows specific code in NetPanzer/Core - OK (SDL specific
 code is in NetPanze/Core/unix now)
-check if the functions and stuff in Lib/terminate.cpp is really needed (looks
 like some strange hacks for the logging functions to me) Can we remove
 this strange code? - Yes we can :) OK
-Fix the win32 stuff in Lib/Util/UtilInterface.cpp - OK
-rewrite win32 event loop to use a SDL event loop. Don't forget to pump mouse
 events to MouseInterface then. - OK
